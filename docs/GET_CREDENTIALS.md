# Getting your Lumen Dev credentials

<p align="center">

</p>

To run this sample app on your own computer, you need two values from your Lumen Dev account:

- An **API key** — a public-ish ID that says "this request is from my organization".
- An **API secret** — a private password that proves it really is you.

Think of them like a username and password, except they're used by the small Express server running on your computer (not by a human typing them at a login screen) to talk to Lumen's online services on your behalf.

> **Note:** An **API** (Application Programming Interface) is the menu of services a system offers to other software. When this sample app asks Lumen "what wallets do I have?", it's calling Lumen's API.

## Step 1 — Sign in to the Lumen Dev portal

### What to do

Open your browser and go to the Lumen Dev portal. Sign in with your organization account.

> **Heads up:** If you don't have an account yet, contact the Lumen team. Dev access is invite-based during the developer preview, so it's not a self-serve sign-up.

### What to expect

You'll land on your organization's dashboard — the main page showing your wallets, files, and other modules.

---

## Step 2 — Open the API Keys section

### What to do

In the dashboard menu, navigate to **Settings** then **API Keys** (the exact path may vary slightly as the product evolves).

### What to expect

A page showing any existing API keys for your organization, with a button to create a new one.

---

## Step 3 — Create a new API key

### What to do

1. Click the **Create** (or **New API Key**) button.
2. Give the key a name you'll recognize — for example, `wallet-sample-localhost`. The name is just a label for you; Lumen doesn't care what it says.
3. Confirm the creation.

### What to expect

A dialog appears showing **two values**: the API key and the API secret.

> **WARNING:** The secret is usually shown **only once**, right after creation. If you close the dialog without copying it, you'll have to delete the key and create a new one. There's no "show secret again" button on purpose — that's a deliberate security choice.

---

## Step 4 — Copy both values immediately

### What to do

Copy the **API key** and the **API secret** into a safe place — a password manager is ideal. A temporary text file is acceptable as long as you delete it after Step 5.

> **TIP:** Do not paste either value into chat applications, screenshots, emails, or anywhere on the public internet. Treat them like passwords.

---

## Step 5 — Paste them into your local `.env` file

### What to do

Follow [SETUP.md Step 5](SETUP.md#step-5--create-your-env-file). Open the `.env` file in a text editor and replace the placeholders:

```
LUMEN_API_KEY=paste-your-api-key-here
LUMEN_API_SECRET=paste-your-api-secret-here
```

becomes (with your real values):

```
LUMEN_API_KEY=abc123-your-real-key
LUMEN_API_SECRET=xyz789-your-real-secret
```

> **Heads up:** No quotes, no spaces around the `=` sign. Save the file when done.

---

## What can each credential do?

| Credential | What it does | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| `LUMEN_API_KEY` | Identifies your organization to Lumen. Public-ish — think of it like an email address. | Server `.env` file only. |
| `LUMEN_API_SECRET` | Proves the request really comes from your organization. The password half. | Server `.env` file only. |

Both values stay on your local Express server (the small program running on your computer at port 8787). The browser side of the app **never** receives them — it only ever talks to the local server, which adds these credentials to outgoing requests before they leave your machine.

---

## If something goes wrong

| What you saw | What it means | How to fix it |
|---|---|---|
| Red banner: `401 Unauthorized` | The key or secret is wrong, has a typo, or was deleted from the Lumen dashboard. | Re-copy both values from the dashboard, paste them into `.env` (no quotes, no extra spaces), save, and restart the app with `npm start`. |
| Red banner: `403 Forbidden` | Your API key is valid, but it doesn't have permission to read wallets. | Contact the Lumen team and ask them to enable the **WALLETS** module on your organization. |
| Error message: `errorMsg: API key not found` | You probably swapped the values — pasted the secret into the key slot or vice versa. | Make sure `LUMEN_API_KEY` holds the public ID and `LUMEN_API_SECRET` holds the secret. |

---

## Keep your credentials safe

> **WARNING:** A leaked API secret is like a leaked password. Anyone who has it can pretend to be your organization until you revoke the key.

A few simple rules:

- **Never commit `.env` to Git.** The included `.gitignore` already prevents this — leave it alone.
- **Never paste your secret anywhere public.** Not in chat, not in Slack, not in a screenshot, not in a support ticket. If you accidentally do, immediately delete that API key from the Lumen dashboard and create a new one.
- **For production deployments**, store the values in your hosting provider's secrets manager (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Render's environment variables, etc.) — never in source control.

> **Tip:** If you ever suspect a secret has leaked, the fastest fix is to delete that API key in the dashboard. Any request using the old secret will instantly fail. Then create a new key and update `.env`.
